##Hi!

This project was done as part of attaining Mark15 required by NeoGcamp for level1. 
Plaindrome Birthday is a simple web-app that takes a date and checks if it's a palindrome or not. It checks this in 4 formats, namely "ddmmyyyy, mmddyyyy, yyyymmdd, ddmmyy". If the entered date isn't a palindrome, the app also calclates the number of days until the next plaindrome and displays the next plaindromic date too.
